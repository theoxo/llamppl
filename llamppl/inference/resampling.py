    """Systematic resampling with a single random offset.

    Generates N equally spaced probe points in [0, 1] with a single
    random offset between 0 and 1/N. Indices are derived by mapping
    these points through the inverse CDF of the categorical distribution
    defined by the weights. Each index i is resampled exactly
    floor(N * w_i) or ceil(N * w_i) times.

    Unlike stratified and residual resampling, systematic resampling
    is not provably lower-variance than multinomial in all cases;
